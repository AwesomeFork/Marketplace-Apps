### App description

ONLYOFFICE Docs is an open-source office suite that comprises web-based viewers and collaborative editors for text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations providing high compatibility with OOXML files (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). Other popular formats such as .doc, .odt, .rtf, .txt, .pdf, .xls, .ods, .csv, .ppt, .odp, etc. are also supported.
You are able to edit complex docs using multiple styling and formatting tools, e.g. shapes, charts, Text Art, drop caps, footnotes, bookmarks, mirror and gutter margins, and more. The pre-installed plugin set as well as the possibility to add your own plugins allows you to implement extra functionality.
Besides, you can create and co-edit fillable document forms, let other users fill them in, and save forms as PDF files.
With multiple collaborative features you can work on the same document together with your teammates: use real-time and paragraph-locking co-editing modes, track changes, comments and mentions, built-in chat, version history.
